            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating machines and systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data, reasoning, understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and even generating content such as text, images, or music.

           The medical field is the broad area of science and practice focused on maintaining health, diagnosing illnesses, treating diseases, and improving the overall well-being of individuals. It includes everything related to healthcare, such as doctors, nurses, surgeons, pharmacists, therapists, and many other professionals who work to prevent and treat physical and mental conditions.

            As AI continues to grow, the advancement it made around the world made things a lot easier in our life. Whether it's handling data or basically human jobs, it's revolutionary, yet it doesn't mean it has no drawbacks. AI is still made out of codes where people can mess with. A recent report from the UK’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) confirms that AI will “almost certainly increase the volume and heighten the impact of cyber-attacks over the next two years”(Sangfor, 2024).

            AI for healthcare offers the ability to process and analyze vast amounts of medical data far beyond human capacity. This capability was instrumental in diagnosing diseases, predicting outcomes, and recommending treatments. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, with greater accuracy and speed than human radiologists, often detecting diseases such as cancer at earlier stages. Examples of artificial intelligence in healthcare are diverse and impactful. A significant development besides IBM’s Watson Health was Google's DeepMind Health project, which demonstrated the ability to diagnose eye diseases from retinal scans with a level of accuracy comparable to human experts. These pioneering projects showcased AI's potential to revolutionize diagnostics and personalized medicine.
            Another significant area where artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare is predictive analytics.

            <div class = "bottom">
                By analyzing patterns in a patient’s medical history and current health data, AI systems can anticipate potential health risks. This predictive capability enables healthcare providers to deliver proactive, preventive care—improving patient outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs.
            Beyond clinical applications, AI is also streamlining administrative processes within healthcare facilities. From appointment scheduling to insurance claim processing, AI-driven automation reduces operational burdens, allowing healthcare professionals to devote more time to patient care. This not only boosts efficiency but also enhances the patient experience.
            The rise of AI in healthcare has been a gradual yet steady progression, driven by technological advancements and the growing demand for improved healthcare delivery.

            AI is still young but what if we did have it now? It already helped us in diagnosis and treatment of disease and has been at the core of artificial intelligence AI in healthcare for the last 50 years. We also have to take into account that using artificial intelligence in healthcare for diagnosis and treatment plans can often be difficult to marry with clinical workflows and EHR systems(Foresee,2024).

            While many healthcare professionals recognize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI), there remains considerable caution around its clinical application. According to a 2025 AMA survey, 66% of physicians are now using AI-powered health tools—up from 38% in 2023—and 68% believe AI contributes positively to patient care. Still, significant concerns persist. Many physicians worry that AI could unduly influence diagnosis and treatment decisions, raising the risks of errors, bias, or misuse.
Nevertheless, the case for integrating AI into healthcare is compelling. Its ability to improve patient outcomes warrants cautious optimism. To foster trust among clinicians, patients, and healthcare institutions, it is critical to acknowledge both the benefits and limitations of AI, and to implement safeguards such as clinical oversight, algorithmic transparency, and strong data protection measures.

            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology that continually learns and adapts. As AI systems are trained to perform specific tasks, they become increasingly capable—but this adaptability also raises ethical concerns. Without moral guidance or oversight, AI can be misused for harmful purposes, such as facilitating cyber-attacks or spreading misinformation.

        One particularly influential branch of AI is Generative AI, which refers to models capable of creating original content. So below is a table showing pros and cons of usage of AI in medical fields.
